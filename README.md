# RSA Encryption & Decryption System  

## Overview  
This project implements an RSA-based encryption and decryption system using asymmetric cryptography. It allows users to generate public and private key pairs, encrypt messages, decrypt messages, and verify digital signatures.  

## Features  
- RSA key generation using two prime numbers (P and Q)  
- Message encryption and decryption with block-based processing  
- Digital signature creation and verification  
- Simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter
